## Specifications

1. A user should be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
2. If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients
3. If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is.
4. If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria.
